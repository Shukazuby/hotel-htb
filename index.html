            <h2><strong>The History</strong> Of Our Hotel</h2>
            <p>
                In the heart of a tranquil coastal town, the HBT Hotel was born as a humble bed-and-breakfast in the late 19th century, run by the hospitable couple, Amelia and Samuel O'Connor. Its reputation for unparalleled hospitality and breathtaking surroundings quickly grew, leading to a grand Victorian-style expansion. Throughout the years, HBT Hotel has hosted esteemed guests from around the world, preserving its timeless charm and commitment to personalized service. Today, the hotel stands as a cherished oasis, 
                embodying the enduring legacy of warmth and enchantment crafted by generations of the O'Connor family.
